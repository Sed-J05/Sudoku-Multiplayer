# Sudoku-Multiplayer
multiplayer sudoku with a fantasy-ish theme
Coded in sfml (C++)
Semester 1 Project with following specifications:

2) must be unconventional (aka not just a simple game cuz we can lift that off the internet
quite rarely bugs out
is kinda dumb cuz some of the checks are being done inside the constant update loop (bad practice)
I used the below link to setup sfml:
